# [Exploratory Data Analysis on Goodreads Data](https://github.com/mablanch/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Goodreads_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb)
- Performed exploratory data analysis on 10,000 books in Python in order to conduct a statistical analysis testing the adage that sequels never live up to the original work, which was shown to be false with regards to novels in this case.

# [Survival Analysis on Glioblastoma Dataset](https://github.com/mablanch/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Survival_Analysis_Gliobastoma_dataset_final_version.pdf)
- Utilized R to implement a Cox Proportional Hazards model via stepwise selection on a glioma patients survival dataset to determine the treatment effect of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) on enrolled patients’ survival and found the patients in the RIT group had a 91.32% lower risk of death than the control group.
